# My First Unity Game
Game name is Blonde.(Sarışın)

# About the Game Name
At first, I named it "Oylesine" because I didn't think of a name for the project. It's kind of like I didn't think of a name, anyway have fun.

# About the Bugs
I develop this game by using the basics of Unity soon after I graduated. So it may have some bugs but it's still playable.

If you die when you get both of the arrows in Authm level, you won't able to do double-jump since the arrows aren't reset.

Sometimes the camera is unstable if you spam crouch, sadly.
